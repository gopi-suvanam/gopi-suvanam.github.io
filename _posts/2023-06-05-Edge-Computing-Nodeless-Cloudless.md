Cloudless computing, also known as edge computing or fog computing, refers to a computing paradigm that emphasizes processing data and running applications at the edge of the network, closer to the data source or end-user device, rather than relying solely on centralized cloud infrastructure. In cloudless computing, the goal is to bring computational capabilities and services closer to where they are needed, reducing latency, improving performance, and enhancing data privacy and security.

### What is Edge/Cloudless Computing?
Unlike traditional cloud computing, where data processing and storage are primarily performed in remote data centers, cloudless computing leverages local computing resources, such as edge devices, IoT devices, or on-premises servers, to perform computations and deliver services. This approach enables faster data processing, real-time analytics, and reduced reliance on network connectivity.

Edge computing offers several advantages:

Reduced latency: By processing data locally at the edge, cloudless computing minimizes the time it takes for data to travel back and forth to remote servers, resulting in lower latency and improved responsiveness.

Improved performance: By distributing computational tasks across edge devices, cloudless computing can handle workloads more efficiently, improving overall system performance and scalability.

Enhanced data privacy and security: Since data remains on the edge devices or local servers, cloudless computing provides greater control and privacy over sensitive data, reducing the need to transfer data to third-party cloud providers.

Offline capabilities: Cloudless computing enables applications to function even when internet connectivity is limited or unreliable, allowing for uninterrupted operation and improved user experience.

Cost optimization: By reducing reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure, cloudless computing can help optimize costs associated with data transfer, storage, and cloud services.

Cloudless computing is particularly useful in scenarios where real-time or near-real-time processing is critical, such as IoT applications, autonomous systems, edge analytics, and remote or mobile environments with limited network connectivity. It complements traditional cloud computing by extending computational capabilities to the edge, providing a more distributed and resilient computing architecture.

It's worth noting that cloudless computing does not completely replace cloud computing but rather complements it. Both paradigms can coexist, with cloud-based services used for certain tasks and cloudless computing employed for edge-specific processing and services.

### What Name to Use?
One could use several names for computing without cloud - Edge computing, cloudless computing, fog computing, nodeless computing. Edge computing refers typically to computing on end devices. Cloudless computing can refer to computing on end devices but also on private (on-premise) servers. Fog computing can refer to computing on end devices and also on other non-cloud devices in a decentralized/distributed fashion. P2P file sharing etc can be called fog computing. Nodeless computing a term i prefer to use for javascript computation in the device without the need for Node.js. It is pun on the word node - meaning a server and the runtime environment node.js. I would have preferred to use serverless computing but that term has been polluted by cloud providers like AWS.

The term "edge computing" is widely used and recognized to describe the concept of processing and analyzing data closer to the source or "edge" of the network, rather than relying on centralized cloud infrastructure. "Edge computing" is a well-established and commonly used term in the industry, and it accurately represents the core idea behind the concept.

While there may be variations or extensions of edge computing, such as "fog computing" or "edge analytics," the term "edge computing" remains the most widely used and understood. It has become a standard term to refer to the decentralized processing and storage of data at or near the network edge.

Using the established term "edge computing" helps ensure clarity and effective communication when discussing distributed computing architectures that bring computation closer to the data source. It allows for consistent understanding and facilitates discussions across various domains and industries.

### Various Paradigms of Edge Computing
Edge computing encompasses multiple paradigms and approaches that can be utilized depending on the specific use case and requirements. Here are some of the prominent paradigms of edge computing:

Fog Computing: Fog computing extends the cloud computing paradigm to the edge of the network, bringing computing resources closer to the data source. It aims to reduce latency and improve performance by processing data at the network edge. Fog computing typically involves deploying computing resources (e.g., servers, storage) in proximity to edge devices.

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC): MEC focuses on pushing computing resources and services to the edge of the mobile network, enabling low-latency and high-bandwidth applications for mobile users. MEC leverages the infrastructure of cellular networks to host computing resources at the edge, enabling tasks like real-time video processing, augmented reality, and low-latency applications.

Cloudlet Computing: Cloudlet computing is a concept where small-scale cloud data centers, known as cloudlets, are deployed at the network edge. Cloudlets serve as intermediate nodes between edge devices and the cloud, providing computational resources and services closer to the end-users. Cloudlets enable faster data processing, reduced network traffic, and improved user experience.

Edge AI: Edge AI focuses on deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities at the edge devices themselves, enabling real-time and localized data processing. By bringing AI algorithms and models to the edge, it reduces the need for sending large amounts of data to the cloud for analysis, improves response times, and enhances privacy and security.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Edge Computing: P2P edge computing leverages the distributed nature of peer-to-peer networks to distribute computing and storage resources across edge devices. It enables collaboration and resource sharing among edge devices, allowing them to collectively perform computations and share data without relying on centralized infrastructure.

Serverless/Nodeless Edge Computing: Serverless computing in the context of edge computing involves running functions or applications on edge devices without the need for managing underlying infrastructure. It allows developers to focus on writing code and deploying applications without worrying about the infrastructure setup. Serverless edge computing can provide scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency for edge applications.
