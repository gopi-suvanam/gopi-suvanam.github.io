[Decentralized Artificial Intelligence](/2023/02/25/Decentralized-Artificial-Intelligence.html) refers to the application of AI technologies in a decentralized environment using various [preimities of decentralized computing](/2023/04/17/Primitives-of-Decentralized-P2P-Computing.html). DAI enables the development of machine learning models and algorithms that can run on multiple nodes in a distributed network without a central authority. DAI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, by enabling secure and efficient sharing of data and resources.

The following are the key primitives of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence:

1. Distributed Learning: Distributed learning is the process of training machine learning models on multiple nodes in a decentralized network. In this approach, data is shared among the nodes, and each node trains a model on its local data. The models are then combined to create a global model. This approach enables efficient use of resources, as the data does not need to be centralized, and each node can contribute its computing power to the training process.

2. Federated Learning: Federated learning is a subset of distributed learning that allows data to remain on individual nodes, and only model updates are shared with a central server. In this approach, the model is trained on each node using local data, and the model updates are sent to a central server, where they are aggregated to create a global model. This approach provides privacy benefits, as the data does not need to be shared between nodes.

3. Decentralized Data Sharing: Decentralized data sharing enables the sharing of data among multiple parties in a decentralized network. In this approach, data is stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain, and access to the data is controlled by smart contracts. This approach provides security benefits, as the data is encrypted and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

4. Decentralized Computation: Decentralized computation enables the execution of computations on multiple nodes in a decentralized network. In this approach, tasks are divided into subtasks and distributed among the nodes, where they are executed in parallel. The results are then aggregated to create a final output. This approach enables efficient use of resources and can provide scalability benefits.

5. Incentive Mechanisms: Incentive mechanisms are used to encourage nodes to participate in a decentralized network. Incentives can be in the form of tokens or other rewards, and are designed to ensure that nodes contribute to the network in a fair and efficient manner. Incentive mechanisms can help to ensure that the network remains secure and reliable. This can be done through a combination of [ML techniques and blockchain technologies](/2023/02/25/Decentralized-Artificial-Intelligence.html#:~:text=Example%20of%20Decentralized%20AI).

### Example of Decentralized Learning
Here is a simple example of JavaScript code for distributed machine learning using TensorFlow.js:
	
	// Define the number of clients and their data
	const numClients = 4;
	const clientData = [
	  [1, 2, 3, 4],
	  [5, 6, 7, 8],
	  [9, 10, 11, 12],
	  [13, 14, 15, 16]
	];
	
	// Define the model architecture
	const model = tf.sequential();
	model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] }));
	
	// Define the optimizer and loss function
	const optimizer = tf.train.sgd(0.01);
	const loss = 'meanSquaredError';
	
	// Define the training function for each client
	async function trainClient(clientId, epochs) {
	  // Get the client data
	  const data = clientData[clientId];
	
	  // Create a tensor with the client data
	  const xs = tf.tensor2d(data, [data.length, 1]);
	
	  // Define the labels
	  const labels = tf.tensor2d(data, [data.length, 1]);
	
	  // Compile the model
	  model.compile({ optimizer, loss });
	
	  // Train the model for the specified number of epochs
	  await model.fit(xs, labels, {
	    epochs,
	    verbose: 0
	  });
	
	  // Dispose the tensors
	  xs.dispose();
	  labels.dispose();
	}
	
	// Train each client for a certain number of epochs
	async function train(epochs) {
	  for (let i = 0; i < numClients; i++) {
	    await trainClient(i, epochs);
	  }
	}
	
	// Evaluate the model on the server
	async function evaluate() {
	  // Get the average loss for each client
	  const losses = [];
	  for (let i = 0; i < numClients; i++) {
	    const data = clientData[i];
	    const xs = tf.tensor2d(data, [data.length, 1]);
	    const labels = tf.tensor2d(data, [data.length, 1]);
	    const loss = model.evaluate(xs, labels, { verbose: 0 }).dataSync()[0];
	    losses.push(loss);
	    xs.dispose();
	    labels.dispose();
	  }
	
	  // Compute the average loss
	  const avgLoss = losses.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / losses.length;
	  console.log('Average loss: ' + avgLoss);
	}
	
	// Train the model for 10 epochs
	await train(10);
	
	// Evaluate the model on the server
	await evaluate();

This code defines a simple linear regression model and trains it on four clients using their local data. The training is performed using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01 and mean squared error loss. After training, the model is evaluated on the server by computing the average loss over all clients.
