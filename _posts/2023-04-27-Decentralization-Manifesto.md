We, the advocates of the Decentralization movement, believe that centralized systems and power structures in the digital realm pose significant risks to individual autonomy, diversity, and innovation. We advocate for a paradigm shift towards decentralized, distributed, and community-driven technologies. We envision a future where individuals and communities have the freedom to participate, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital ecosystem. We assert the following principles as the foundation of our manifesto:

Empowerment of Individuals and Communities: We believe that technology should empower individuals and communities, rather than concentrate power in the hands of a few entities. We advocate for technologies that give users control over their data, digital assets, and online interactions. We support the principles of self-sovereign identity, where individuals have the right to own, control, and share their personal information as they see fit.

Diversity and Inclusivity: We recognize that centralization can lead to homogeneity and exclusion, stifling diversity and innovation. We promote technologies that foster diversity, inclusivity, and equal participation, regardless of geographical location, socio-economic status, or other barriers. We oppose centralized systems that perpetuate discrimination, bias, or censorship, and advocate for technologies that promote fairness, transparency, and accountability.

Resilience and Robustness: We acknowledge that centralization creates a single point of failure, making systems vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and disruption. We advocate for decentralized technologies that distribute data, processing, and decision-making across multiple nodes, enhancing resilience and robustness. We support the use of distributed ledgers, such as blockchain, that provide tamper-proof and transparent record-keeping, without relying on a central authority.

Openness and Interoperability: We believe that interoperability and open standards are essential for fostering innovation, competition, and collaboration. We oppose proprietary systems that lock users into closed ecosystems and hinder interoperability with other technologies. We advocate for open-source, transparent, and auditable technologies that allow for independent verification, peer review, and community participation.

Privacy and Security: We recognize that privacy and security are fundamental rights in the digital age. We oppose the surveillance, exploitation, and misuse of personal data by centralized entities. We advocate for technologies that prioritize privacy by design, use end-to-end encryption, and allow for user-controlled data sharing. We support the use of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, that enable secure and private transactions without revealing sensitive information.

Local Control and Self-Governance: We believe that individuals and communities should have the right to determine how their data is stored, processed, and shared. We oppose the dependence on centralized systems that may be subject to censorship, manipulation, or external influence. We advocate for technologies that enable local control, self-governance, and community-driven decision-making, empowering users to shape the digital environment according to their needs and values.

Ethical Use of Technology: We recognize the ethical implications of technology, including issues related to bias, discrimination, and fairness. We oppose the use of technology for unethical purposes, such as surveillance, manipulation, or harm. We advocate for ethical considerations in the design, development, and use of technologies, with a focus on transparency, accountability, and social responsibility.

Collaboration and Community Engagement: We believe that collaboration and community engagement are essential for creating decentralized, user-centric technologies. We oppose top-down, authoritarian models of technology development and deployment that lack transparency, inclusivity, and diversity of voices. We advocate for community-driven, participatory approaches that involve users, developers, researchers, and other stakeholders in decision-making processes.
