Decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) is a new paradigm that promises to revolutionize the way we develop and deploy AI systems. Traditional AI systems rely on centralized architectures that require large amounts of data and computing power to function effectively. In contrast, decentralized AI systems leverage distributed networks to achieve their objectives. Decentralized AI is an especially powerful tool for [Small Data AI](/2021/05/26/Small-Data-AI.html). In this article, we will explore what decentralized AI is, its advantages, and its potential impact on various industries. Google search of Decentralized AI will give lot of results where AI is built on top on Blockchain. This approch is not fruitful as [Decentralization!=Blockchain](/2022/12/14/Decentralization-is-not-blockchain.html).

### Decentralized AI: What is it?

Decentralized AI refers to the concept of building AI systems that operate on decentralized networks. These networks can be peer-to-peer (P2P) or blockchain-based, and they allow multiple nodes to work together to achieve a common objective. Decentralized AI systems operate differently from centralized ones because they do not rely on a single entity to control the system. Instead, they use distributed consensus mechanisms to reach decisions and execute tasks.

Decentralized AI systems are composed of several components, including decentralized data storage, decentralized computing power, and decentralized decision-making. These components work together to create a system that is more resilient, secure, and scalable than traditional AI systems.


### Advantages of Decentralized AI

Decentralized AI offers several advantages over traditional AI systems, including:

- Enhanced privacy and security: Decentralized AI systems operate on distributed networks, which means that data is not stored in a central location. This reduces the risk of data breaches and hacking attacks.

- Increased transparency: Decentralized AI systems are transparent because they operate on open networks. This means that anyone can see how the system is functioning, and there is no single entity controlling the system.

- Improved scalability: Decentralized AI systems are more scalable than traditional AI systems because they can leverage the computing power of multiple nodes in the network.

- Reduced costs: Decentralized AI systems are less expensive to operate because they do not require large data centers or expensive hardware.

- Democratization of AI: Decentralized AI systems make it easier for individuals and small organizations to develop and deploy AI applications because they do not require a significant investment in infrastructure.


### Potential Impact of Decentralized AI

Decentralized AI has the potential to impact various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Here are some examples:

- Finance: Decentralized AI can help financial institutions automate processes, reduce fraud, and improve customer experience. For example, decentralized AI can be used to analyze customer data and provide personalized recommendations for financial products and services.

- Healthcare: Decentralized AI can help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes by analyzing medical data and providing personalized treatment plans. It can also be used to improve medical research by enabling the sharing of medical data between institutions.

- Supply Chain Management: Decentralized AI can help companies optimize their supply chain by analyzing data from various sources, such as suppliers, logistics providers, and customers. This can help companies reduce costs, improve delivery times, and increase customer satisfaction.

### Technologies for Decentralized (Artificial) Intelligence

Here are some technologies that can be used for decentralized intelligence:

1. Blockchain: Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and secure way to store and share data, which is essential for decentralized intelligence. Blockchain-based platforms like Ethereum and EOS provide the ability to build and deploy smart contracts, which can be used to automate decision-making processes and enable decentralized applications.

2. Distributed Computing: Distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Apache Flink enable large-scale data processing and machine learning on distributed systems. These frameworks can be used to distribute workloads across multiple nodes and enable parallel processing, which is essential for decentralized intelligence.

3. Federated Learning: Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables training models on decentralized data sources, without requiring the data to be centralized. Federated learning can be used to train models on data from multiple devices or nodes, while keeping the data private and secure.

4. Swarm Intelligence: Swarm intelligence is an approach to decentralized decision-making that is inspired by the behavior of social insects like ants and bees. Swarm intelligence algorithms can be used to solve optimization problems and enable decentralized decision-making in a variety of scenarios.

5. Peer-to-Peer Networks: Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can be used to enable decentralized communication and collaboration between nodes. P2P networks can be used to share data and algorithms between nodes, and to enable decentralized decision-making in distributed systems.

These are just a few examples of the technologies that can be used for decentralized intelligence. Decentralized intelligence requires a combination of distributed computing, artificial intelligence, and secure communication technologies, and is a rapidly evolving field with many promising applications.

### Example of Decentralized AI

Here is a small code snippet of two technologies: machine leanring and blockchain can come together to make decentralized AI (note: this is is no way a practical code but only a pointer):

    const Web3 = require('web3');
    const contractABI = require('my-contract-abi.json');
    const contractAddress = '0x1234567890abcdef';

    // Connect to the Ethereum network
    const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-project-id');

    // Create a contract instance
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

    // Make a prediction using the AI model
    const prediction = myAIModel.predict(data);

    // Call a function on the smart contract
    contract.methods.makeDecision(prediction).send({from: myAddress, gas: 100000})
      .on('receipt', function(receipt){
        console.log('Decision made successfully');
      });


In this example, we're using the Web3.js library to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with a smart contract that makes decisions using an AI model. We first load the contract ABI and address, then create an instance of the contract using the Web3.js library.

Next, we use our AI model to make a prediction based on some input data. We then call the makeDecision function on the smart contract, passing in the prediction as an argument. This function will trigger a transaction on the Ethereum network, which will execute the decision-making logic on the contract. We can use a [machine learning model built in JavaScript](https://gopi-suvanam.github.io/2023/02/22/Why-JavaScript-is-Great.html).

When the transaction is confirmed, we print a message to the console to indicate that the decision was made successfully. Note that this is a very simplified example, and a real-world implementation of a decentralized AI system would require much more complex code and infrastructure.
